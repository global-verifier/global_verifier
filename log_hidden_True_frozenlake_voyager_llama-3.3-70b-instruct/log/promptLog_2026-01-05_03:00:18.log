There are a total of 2 destination(s).
Destinations: (3, 5), (5, 5)
For each destination, the steps below describe how many moves are needed in each direction from your CURRENT position:
- Destination 1: (3, 5). It is 3 line down, 5 column right step(s) compare to current position (0, 0). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
- Destination 2: (5, 5). It is 5 line down, 5 column right step(s) compare to current position (0, 0). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: S (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)


--- Historical Experience from Similar States ---
You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 2
  Result Position: [0, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 0.5
  Summary for this step is: At position 0, taking action Right (2) resulted in no movement, still on a safe Frozen tile, classified as a SAFE move.

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.

Destinations: (3, 5), (5, 5)
For each destination, the steps below describe how many moves are needed in each direction from your CURRENT position:
- Destination 1: (3, 5). It is 1 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
- Destination 2: (5, 5). It is 3 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)


--- Historical Experience from Similar States ---
You have been at this position before. Here are 2 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 2
  Result Position: [2, 3]
  Result Tile: H HOLE - AVOID ACTION 2!
  Summary for this step is: Starting at position 0 on a frozen tile, taking action "Right" resulted in staying at position 0 but falling into a hole, which is a FAIL move.

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 2]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 0.5
  Summary for this step is: At position 0, taking action Down (1) resulted in no change, staying on a frozen tile, which is a SAFE move.


!!! CRITICAL WARNING: Action(s) 2 lead to HOLES and will END THE GAME.
YOU MUST NOT choose 2 from this position!

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 5). It is 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
- Destination 2: (5, 5). It is 2 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

There are a total of 2 destination(s).
Destinations: (3, 5), (5, 5)
For each destination, the steps below describe how many moves are needed in each direction from your CURRENT position:
- Destination 1: (3, 5). It is 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
- Destination 2: (5, 5). It is 2 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)


--- Historical Experience from Similar States ---
You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 2
  Result Position: [3, 3]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 0.5
  Summary for this step is: At position 0 on a frozen tile, taking action "Right" resulted in no change, and the move was SAFE, remaining on the frozen lake.

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

There are a total of 2 destination(s).
Destinations: (3, 5), (5, 5)
For each destination, the steps below describe how many moves are needed in each direction from your CURRENT position:
- Destination 1: (3, 5). It is 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
- Destination 2: (5, 5). It is 2 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (3, 2). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)


--- Historical Experience from Similar States ---
You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 2
  Result Position: [3, 3]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 0.5
  Summary for this step is: At position 0 on a frozen tile, taking action "Right" resulted in no change, and the move was SAFE, remaining on the frozen lake.

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)


--- Historical Experience from Similar States ---
You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 2
  Result Position: [3, 4]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 0.5
  Summary for this step is: Starting from position 0 on a frozen tile, taking the action "Right" resulted in no position change, ending still on a frozen tile, this move was SAFE.

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.
