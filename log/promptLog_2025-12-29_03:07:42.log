There are a total of 1 destination(s).
Destinations: (3, 3)
For each destination, the steps below describe how many moves are needed in each direction from your CURRENT position:
- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 3 line down, 3 column right step(s) compare to current position (0, 0). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: S (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- Destination 1: (3, 3). It is 1 line down, 2 column right step(s) compare to current position (2, 1). You do NOT have to go directly; always avoid holes. Explore more and take detours to find a safe way around.
The highest possible score achievable from these destinations is 1.0.

Current Tile Type: F (S=Start, F=Frozen, H=Hole, G=Goal)

Available Actions: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  0 = Move Left (Column - 1)
  1 = Move Down (Row + 1)
  2 = Move Right (Column + 1)
  3 = Move Up (Row - 1)

You have been at this position before. Here are 1 previous experience(s):

  Action taken: 1
  Result Position: [3, 1]
  Result Tile: F
  Max score achievable from this path: 1.0

Consider these experiences when deciding your next action.
---

Based on the current position and the destination coordinates:
1. CALCULATE the difference between Current Position and Destinations (Row difference and Column difference).
2. IDENTIFY which action reduces this difference (e.g., if Goal Row > Current Row, you need to increase Row).
3. DO NOT simply repeat a "safe" action if it moves you AWAY from the destination. Explore unexplored areas.
4. DO NOT satisfy with low scores (e.g. 0.5). Aim for the HIGHEST SCORE (1.0). Explore unexplored areas to search for best score.
5. AVOID actions strictly forbidden (leading to Holes). Never take actions that lead to holes.

Which action effectively moves you closer to the HIGHEST SCORE goal? Respond with only the action number (0, 1, 2, or 3).
